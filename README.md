Robot at origin (0,0) on 2D plane. Given a sequence of moves, determine if the robot ends up at (0,0).
Moves represented by string eg. "UDLRDDUR".
Do not factor in the way the robot is facing- directions are absolute not relative.
Robot moves one unit each move.
Return a boolean: True if robot back at origin, else false.
